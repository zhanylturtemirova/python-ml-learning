Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. 
It employs algorithms to identify patterns in data, make predictions, and refine performance over time. 
ML is broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled datasets to predict outcomes, such as detecting spam in emails. 
Unsupervised learning, by contrast, identifies hidden patterns in unlabeled data, often used in clustering and dimensionality reduction tasks. 
Reinforcement learning involves agents making decisions in dynamic environments, learning optimal strategies through feedback and rewards.

Machine learning is widely applied in fields like finance, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing. 
It powers recommendation systems, fraud detection, and even advanced chatbots. 
However, challenges like data quality, interpretability, and ethical concerns continue to shape its development, driving the need for robust frameworks and practices.
